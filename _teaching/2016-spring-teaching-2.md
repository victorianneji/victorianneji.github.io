Introduction to the theory, principles, and methods used to conceive, design and analyze systems. Focus
areas include problem identification, description, modeling and simulation, design, test and evaluation
issues, as well as more broad lifecycle concerns. Two 1.5 hr classes weekly. Prerequisite: Senior
standing in engineering.

My Contribution
======
• Led lectures on simulation, software and product lifecycle management for 30 students/term.
• Mentored mechanical engineering, management students’ projects for BD Technologies, NASA.

Learning Outcomes
======
• Understand the roles and responsibilities of typical systems engineers, and how these fit into a
company’s overall organization.
• Understand how fundamental concepts from disciplines such as probability, economics, and
cognitive science relate to systems engineering.
• Apply systems engineering tools (e.g., stakeholder identification, requirements development and
management, robust design principles) to realistic problems.
• Formulate an effective plan for gathering and using technical and sociotechnical data.
• Identify areas that could be served by modeling and simulation, and identify the associated
benefits and limitations.
• Understand how to design for and manage the system lifecycle.
• Develop a systems engineering plan for a realistic project.
• Be able to evaluate a systems engineering plan for soundness and identify areas of strengths and
weaknesses.
