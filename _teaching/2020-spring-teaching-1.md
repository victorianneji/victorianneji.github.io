ME 555 / ECE 590 / EGRMGMT 590: Autonomous Systems Engineering is for ambitious junior, senior, master, and PhD students in mechanical engineering, electrical / computer engineering, and engineering management. This course fosters an inclusive and accessible learning environment. Students learn how to design and manage real-world operations in industries that integrate robotics and artificial intelligence in human-machine systems. Lessons include work with industry client, guest lectures, case studies, paired problem solving, and test & evaluation plans.

Objectives
======
• Understand how the fundamental components of an autonomous system (physical system, perception and sensing, planning and control) contribute to an integrated system.

• Understand how fundamental concepts from fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, and human robot interaction relate to autonomous systems engineering.

• Apply systems engineering tools (e.g., stakeholder identification, requirements development, robust design principles) to realistic systems.

• Identify areas that could be served by modeling and simulation, and identify the associated benefits and limitations.

• Identify strengths and weaknesses in the design of different autonomous systems.

• Develop and review a test and evaluation plan for an autonomous systems.

• Understand the social, legal, and policy challenges associated with the design and introduction of autonomous systems.

Assessment
======
Student learning is assessed based on preparation, participation, and presentation in class.

• Class participation: 10%

• Case Study presentation: 10%

• Midterm: 20%

• Project: 40%

• Project evaluation: 20%

Assignments
======
1. Class participation is the student's combined effort in being prepared (completing readings and activities prior to each class period), asking questions, and sharing your own reflections. Assessed over the course of the semester.

2. By the end of the semester, each student pair is expected to have presented an original case study on an autonomous system that is in research, development, deployment, operation, or retirement.  It can be in any stage of the systems engineering lifecycle but there should be sufficient information in the public domain to allow each pair to research and present a critical analysis of the methods, results, directions as well as strengths and weaknesses of the autonomous system. Due during one class period this semester.

3. The midterm exam is a test of how well students understand the fundamental components of an autonomous system, how to apply systems engineering tools to autonomous systems, and how well students work together as pairs in communicating learning.  This will be open-book, open-Internet, and students can consult with their partner. Due Wednesday, March 4, 2020.

4. The project is a real-world assignment from a company with a real-world problem.  This is an opportunity to learn how to listen intently, ask insightful questions, develop solutions, solicit requirements, and develop a test plan to evaluate how well the design of autonomous systems meet client needs. About 75% of this work will culminate in a written report while 25% will be communicated in person through an executive summary-style presentation to the client. Due Friday, April 17, 2020.

5. Finally, the fun part.  Each student will get to evaluate another pair’s project by writing a comprehensive and constructive analysis on their written report and presentation. Due Monday, April 27, 2020.
