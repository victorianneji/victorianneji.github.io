The [Simulator of Humans and Automation in Dispatch Operations (SHADO)](http://apps.hal.pratt.duke.edu/shado/) is a tool that allows you to rapidly prototype dispatch operations of transportation systems. SHADO simulates the work of dispatchers and fleet managers under various operating conditions during a shift. With SHADO, you can tune numerous parameters, run the simulation for multiple days, then see the distribution of operator workload and error as well as system delays.

Here is a video introduction to this area of work:
