Simulator of Humans and Automation in Dispatch Operations (SHADO) is a tool that allows you to rapidly prototype dispatch operations of transportation systems. SHADO simulates the work of dispatchers and fleet managers under various operating conditions during a shift. With SHADO, you can tune numerous parameters, run the simulation for multiple days, then see the distribution of operator workload and error as well as system delays.
