The <a href="http://apps.hal.pratt.duke.edu/show/">Simulator of Human Operator Workload (SHOW)</a> is a tool to simulate a freight rail operator's workload across the duration of a given trip. With SHOW, you can choose a trip with unique conditions and then see the operator's average workload after thousands of similar trips.
