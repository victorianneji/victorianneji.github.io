The concept of On-Demand Mobility (ODM) in aviation has gained popularity in recent
years, with several manufacturers proposing vehicles for high-speed intra-city air taxis.
However, less attention has been placed on how these fleets would be operationally controlled
and managed. Through the development of concepts of operations for remote management of
vehicles with differing levels of autonomy, this paper presents preliminary requirements for
ODM air operations control centers. The centers would interface with air traffic control and
be responsible for ensuring safe, efficient, and effective operations of fleets within subareas of
the National Airspace System. Our effort identified key functional requirements related to
vehicle safety, customer experience, and airspace integration for these futuristic concepts.
Further, this work introduces a novel Remote Operations Center (ROC) concept with highly
integrated human-machine systems for efficient operations with limited staffing. The ROC
would support the transition from providing dispatcher-like support to supervisory control of
autonomous ODM systems, including managing emergencies, which will be crucial for
operational success as vehicle autonomy evolves.
