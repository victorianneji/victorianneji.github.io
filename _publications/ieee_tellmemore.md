title: "Tell Me More: Designing HRI to Encourage More Trust, Disclosure, and Companionship"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/ieee_tellmemore
excerpt: 'Previous HRI research has established that trust, disclosure, and a sense of companionship lead to positive outcomes. In this study, we extend existing work by exploring behavioral approaches to increasing these three aspects of HRI. We engaged (N = 61) high
school aged students in a 2 (vulnerability of robot: high vs. low) x 2 (expressivity of robot: high vs. low) between-subjects study
where participants engaged in a short electronics learning activity with a robotic tutor. Our results show that students had
more trust and feelings of companionship with a vulnerable robot, and reported disclosing more with an expressive robot. These findings suggest that vulnerability and expressivity may improve peoplesâ€™ relationships with robots.'

This paper is about the impact of emotive user interface designs on human-robot interaction, trust, companionship, and disclosure. I collaborated with Stanford University School of Engineering professors and a rising leader in design research.
